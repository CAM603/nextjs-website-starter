## Next.js Website Starter

Every good website needs some boilerplate items. At the very least a header and footer. This is a Next.js Starter that let's you hit the ground running for your next project.

## Motivation

I find myself spending a lot of time setting up websites, re-creating a lot of similar things in different ways. If I had a basic started project, I can substantially decrease my setup time and delivery of the product. I want this to be available for others to use as well - and contribute to!

## Code Examples

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out how your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Getting Started

Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
